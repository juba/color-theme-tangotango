This is an emacs color theme based on the tango palette colors.

* Screenshots

Here is a screenshot of the color theme with an emacs-lisp file :

* Installation instructions

** Emacs 24

Emacs 24 features native color theming, and as such you don't need any third
party package or extension.

1. Download =tangotango-theme.el= from [[https://github.com/juba/color-theme-tangotango/raw/master/tangotango-theme.el][github]] and save it to your =~/.emacs.d= directory
2. Try it with =M-x load-theme=
3. If you like it, just add the following line to your =.emacs= :

#+begin_src
(load-theme 'tangotango t)
#+end_src

If you prefer to place your theme files in another directory, you can just add
something like the following in your =.emacs= before loading the theme :

#+begin_src
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/color-theme-tangotango")
#+end_src

** Emacs 23

With Emacs 23 you need to use the =color-theme= package :

1. Download and install the =color-theme= emacs package either via your linux distribution or [[http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme/#sec5][via the source tarball]]
2. Download and install =color-theme-tangotango.el= from [[http://github.com/juba/color-theme-tangotango/raw/master/color-theme-tangotango.el][github]]
3. Make sure that both =color-theme.el= and =color-theme-tangotango.el= are in your load path

There are several ways to load the tangotango color theme from your =.emacs=, as
documented on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme][emacswiki]]. The way I currently use should work for a daemonized
emacs and allows the selection of different themes for GUI or console based
frames :

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'color-theme)
(setq color-theme-load-all-themes nil)

(require 'color-theme-tangotango)

;; select theme - first list element is for windowing system, second is for console/terminal
;; Source : http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme#toc9
(setq color-theme-choices 
      '(color-theme-tangotango color-theme-tangotango))

;; default-start
(funcall (lambda (cols)
    	   (let ((color-theme-is-global nil))
    	     (eval 
    	      (append '(if (window-system))
    		      (mapcar (lambda (x) (cons x nil)) 
    			      cols)))))
    	 color-theme-choices)

;; test for each additional frame or console
(require 'cl)
(fset 'test-win-sys 
      (funcall (lambda (cols)
    		 (lexical-let ((cols cols))
    		   (lambda (frame)
    		     (let ((color-theme-is-global nil))
		       ;; must be current for local ctheme
		       (select-frame frame)
		       ;; test winsystem
		       (eval 
			(append '(if (window-system frame)) 
				(mapcar (lambda (x) (cons x nil)) 
					cols)))))))
    	       color-theme-choices ))
;; hook on after-make-frame-functions
(add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'test-win-sys)

(color-theme-tangotango)
#+end_src

Note that I also had to add a (color-theme-tangotango) line at the end of my
=.gnus= file in order to apply the color theme to Gnus.
